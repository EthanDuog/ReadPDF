link for more detail how i do it:https://medium.com/@ethan.duong1120/today-i-used-a-little-python-at-work-6d06bdf9cc30 
Using Python to read pdf files and verify files that contain specific substrings.
I worked as a technical assistant, and part of my job is support people with disability in computer operations. Last shift, a blind man request me support him to read all pdf resumes to locate a specific key word.

I immediately think why don’t use this opportunity to implement sub code to read all pdf files and locate the key words in each resume.

There are 39 resumes to be read, I will layout the code I implemented to read with those file. However, for the sake of privacy, I will not use the exact resume names.

Context: Helping a blind person to find the ideal candidate for a job positions by skimming through resumes.
Purpose: with 29 pdf files located in one folder, identify the file that contains “Union” and “Human Resource”. (we will use 7 pdf files only)
Expected result: desired file paths, which contain the above key words.
Expected resources: Python skills, Google Collab. Time: 2 hours.
